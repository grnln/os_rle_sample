# RLE Compression Example

## About

This is a simple RLE compression example implemented in C99 for the Operating Systems subject.

## Compiling

This currently only compiles under Linux, but getting it to compile in Windows would be a matter of modifying the Makefile (the project has no depedencies).

To compile the packing program:

```bash
make pack
```

To compile the unpacking program:

```bash
make unpack
```

To clean up:

```bash
make clean
```
